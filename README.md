# Summary

Population dynamics can influence the shape of a tree. Another thing that has strong influence on the shape of the tree is structure in a population. This is the case as soon as sequences do not mix well, i.e. they cluster together. One cause of this clustering is due to geography. Samples may not have been taken from the same geographic region, leading to clustering of samples from the same region. This clustering of samples can bias the estimation of parameters. The extension of the classic coalescent to the structured coalescent by allowing for migration between regions is trying to circumvent this by allowing individual regions to have distinct coalescent rates and by allowing migration between those regions.
